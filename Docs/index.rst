The EnergyScope Multi-Cells model
==================================
The EnergyScope Multi-Cells (ESMC) project is an open-source multi-regional whole-energy system  model. It optimises the design and hourly operation of multiple interconnected regions over a year for a target year. It is build as an extension of the regional model `EnergyScope <https://github.com/energyscope/EnergyScope/>`_.
This documentation presents the generic multi-regional whole-energy system optimization model and its implementation on a fossil-free European energy system for 2050. However, the model is suited for any multi-regional energy system and has been applied to other case studies, see :doc:`/sections/Releases` section.

EnergyScope is mainly developped by EPFL (Switzerland) and UCLouvain (Belgium). See :doc:`/sections/Releases` section for acknowledgment, versions and publications.
